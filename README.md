# go-bambou

Bends but does not break, in Go


## description

`Bambou` is a Go ReST layer for Nuage Networks' APIs base concepts.It provides layer for manipulating ReST entities.
`Bambou` can not really be used as is, and mostly need to work with `Monolithe` to generate a layer that will use `gobambou`
correctly.


More information in the README soon.
